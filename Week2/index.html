  <h4> <strong> Process </strong> </h4>
  <p> When starting this project, I was still very new to the program Fusion 360 so I wanted to go through one of the tutorials once more to get all the steps correct. I figured my time in the lab on Monday would be the time and place to do it.
      Overall, I was less concerned about the final result than I was about getting comfortable with Fusion 360 and with the laser cutter. I can always make more complex projects later once I get these things down.
      <br> I made several of these objects (left) and brought them over to the cutter. Once there we noticed that the laser cutter was cutting the object twice. We ended up with 8 objects on this round. We deleted one layer of the design and tried again.
This time it only cut once as it is suppose to do and I got another 8 objects. Not sure how this happened but maybe somehow I saved two sketches on top of each other (right).</p>

<h4> <strong> Findings </strong> </h4>
  <p> The objects that were cut twice where perhaps slightly smaller and resulted in looser fits when jointed. Other than that there wasn't too much of a noticable difference.
    <br> Below: Properly cut (left) and cut twice (right)</p>

  <h4> <strong> Summary </strong> </h4>
  <p> I'm looking forward to using these tools to make more laser cut projects in the future. </p>
