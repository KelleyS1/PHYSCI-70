<h4> Final Project Update Part 1: Tuesday</h4>
      <p> <center> Assignment: Update your website with more information about your final project, including a bill of materials and project plan (including whether you'll need 3D printed parts).
</center> <br><br>

As the above says, I'l be listing my bill of materials and my project plan as I see it now.</p>
<h4> <center> Bill of Materials: </center> </h4>
<p>  <div class="center-list">
  <ol>
  <li>(3-5) solenoids with corresponding transistors (need more of these!)</center></li>
  <li>(1) teensy or nano</li>
  <li>(2-3) DC Motors (1-2) H-bridges</li>
  <li>(2) Steppers with (2) bridges</li>
  <li>(1) 9v Power Supply</li>
  <li>jumper cables</li>
  <li>(2) bread board with the power rails split</li>
  <li>toggle switch</li>
  <li>soldering iron and solder</li>
<br> <p> <em> Software</em> </p>
  <li>Max MSP with maxuino downloaded</li>
  <li>Arduino ID with the Firmata library installed</li>
</ol></div> </p>

<h4> <center> Plan: </center> </h4>


<p> Unfortunately, I dont think I'll have time to design a 3D printed box in time before this project should be finished.
I'll hopefully be able to use a smallish cardboard box instead of something 3D printed. Maybe I can print it next semester or once I have access to a 3D printer again.
I think, that this project will still be great without it. Last semester, I designed something similar but it ran on a midi file that was
automated rather then "played" live. Also, it didn't include stepper motors. Below is a photo of it. It's much messier looking
then I plan to have this final project.
<br>
My plan is to build off the below circuits and prototype. Additionally, to shrink it to one board rather then the two I used here.
 I'm hoping to not use breadboards either, I'd like this to be a bit more permanent. Luckily, I've already written the
max MSP patch, so I'll just expand on it to include the new motors and to talk to just a single board. Getting it to speak to the midikeyboard board is also pretty straight forward!</p>
