    <h3><center> An Arduino Nano using an H-Bridge to control a stepper motor </center></h3> <br>

      <p> In this section, I will outline how to use an Arduino Nano to control a stepper motor.
      I'll illustrate how to hook up the power source, the stepper motor to the H-Bridge, and reveal the Arduino IDE code  below.
    It's common to use an Arduino Uno for this project, since it has a lovely onboard barrel connector to add the necessary 9v power supply.
  But, if you are in a situation where you need a smaller form than that of the Uno then the Nano is the way to go. </p>
<br><br>

      <h4> <center> step 1: materials </center> </h4>
      <p><ol>
        <li>an Arduino Nano + USB cable</li>
        <li>(1) stepper motor</li>
        <li>H-bridge</li>
        <li>(1) 9v Power Supply</li>
        <li>jumper cables</li>
        <li>(1) bread board with the power rails split (as I am using) or (2) smaller bread boards </li>
<br> <p> <em> OPTIONAL</em> </p>
        <li>9v battery snap with barrel connection</li>
        <li>(2) male crimps</li>
        <li>toggle switch</li>
        <li>soldering iron and solder</li>
      </ol></p>

<h4> <center> step 3: connect the stepper to the H-Bridge  </center> </h4>

<p> The stepper I am using has four color-coded wires terminated with bare leads:
  black and green connect to one coil; red and blue connect to the other. </p>

<h4> <center> step 4: power supply!  </center> </h4>

<p> Now we add the power supply that will power the motor. I added a little toggle switch to my circuit because it is
a pain to have to plug and unplug the power supply if you want to update the code or anything in which you need to kill the power. But
the switch is not necessary. Additionally, to plug the power supply into the board, I cut open an extra
<A HREF="../Week7/9v.png">9v battery snap with a barrel connecter</A>
that I had lying around. If you have one of these lying around and want to do this this yourself.
If you have another method then feel free to use that and skip to the second part of this step.
Here are the steps I took, you will also need to solder and have (2) "male crimps dupont connectors" (also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Lb1Dawq4cQ"> here is info to make your own dupont cables,</a> should the mood strike you):
<br>1) I cut off the snap end and <A HREF="../Week7/cutsnap.jpg"> exposed the POWER and GND wires.</a>
  <br> 2) I soldered these wires to <A HREF="../Week7/bbfriendly.jpg">"male crimp pins" to make
them more breadboard friendly.</a>
<br> 3) plugged the power supply into the barrel of the wire.
<br> 4) The GND went to the ground rail, the power went to the power rail on the breadboard NOT ON THE SIDE WITH THE NANO.</p>
<br>
<br>
Now, to add this power to the H-Bridge:
<br> 1) take the GND and VCC wires you put aside in  <a href="#step2">Step 2</a> and
<br> 2)connect these wires to the GND and POWER rails that you are powering with the Power Supply.
<br> 3) since you are either using (2) small disconnected breadboards or (1) larger breadboard with a split in the power rail, you'll need to
connect the GND to the GND on the Nano by <A HREF="../Week7/gndtognd.jpg"> placing a jumper </a> between the GND Rail on the powered breadboard and the GND pin on the Nano.


<br><br>
  <h4> <center> step 5: the code  </center> </h4>

  <p> make sure to plug in your NANO using the USB cord into your laptop. Open Arduino IDE and upload the code from below onto your board.
   Tweak the delay variable to make it run slower or faster. Have fun!</p>
  <br>  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
    /*
     Stepper Motor Control - one step at a time Uses stepper.h library. This program drives a unipolar or bipolar stepper motor.The motor is attached to digital pins 8 - 11 of the Arduino.
     The motor will step one step at a time, very slowly.  You can use this to test that you've got the four wires of your stepper wired to the correct
     pins. If wired correctly, all steps should be in the same direction. Use this also to count the number of steps per revolution of your motor, if you don't know it.  Then plug that number into the oneRevolution
     example to see if you got it right.

    #include <Stepper.h>

    const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;  // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution
    // for your motor

    // initialize the stepper library on pins 8 through 11:
    Stepper myStepper(stepsPerRevolution, 11, 10, 9, 7);

    int stepCount = 0;         // number of steps the motor has taken

    void setup() {
      // initialize the serial port:
      Serial.begin(9600);
    }

    void loop() {
      // step one step:
      myStepper.step(1);
      Serial.print("steps:");
      Serial.println(stepCount);
      stepCount++;
      delay(500);
