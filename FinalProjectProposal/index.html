  <h3>Final Project Proposal </h3> <br>
  <p> I am hoping to control a variety of motors and solenoids using a midi keyboard. The would create an interesting musical instrument with many possiblities. This could use a microcontroller interfacing with Max MSP. A few DC motors could have fixed speeds to sound like a saw tooth oscillator. While a few motors would be more variable and perhaps controlled by the mod. week or other CC messages on the midi keyboard. The motors in consideration are DC motors, steppers, and solenoids.</p>
