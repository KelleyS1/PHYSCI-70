  <h3>Week 10: More IoT! </h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> Unfortunately this week was a hard one for me personally. I really didn't have time to go through the tutorials and
      when I did I ran into a few errors. I'll document it below along with the solutions. Though one issue did stop me from
    progressing beyond tutorial 1b at the time of writing this. I'm talking with a few folks over on the class slack so hopefully I solve it after writing this. If so, I'll try to update at the bottom.
    I followed these lovely (and very well documented!) tutorials from you all. Hopefully next
  week will be less personally difficult, but honestly who knows what to expect in this pandemic filled world. I hope everyone is doing okay. </p>
