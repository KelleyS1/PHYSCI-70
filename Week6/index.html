  <h3>Week 6: Input Devices </h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> This week we were to make capacitive sensors as well as our own
       sensor/input device. The capative sensor came together pretty easily
     using Robert Hart's arduino code and the capative sensor we made in class. </p>

<h3> Capacitive Sensor </h3>
     <p>I tried out 3 different possible materials to see which would gather the best data to measure pressure.
     I found these materials around the lab and then cut them down to fit between the two sides of the sensor.
   The materials I used were a soft foam, cardboard, and a fairly stiff board.</p>

      <h4> The Data </h4>
      <p> Amoung the three, I thought the cardboard felt like the most reliable and most intuitive material to use. The data also
       seemed the most accurate to me. Below is a photo of the data collected while using these materials with the sensor.</p>

       <h4> The Code </h4>
<p>Here is the arduino IDE code as kindly provided by Robert Hart. </p>

       <pre><code class="language-arduino">

         #include < CapacitiveSensor.h> //including the capativie sensor.h
  CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(7,9);
  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
  }

  void loop() {
    long sensorValue = Sensor.capacitiveSensor(1000);      //Change the number of samples to get the required timing and sensitivity.
    //delay(10);
    Serial.println(sensorValue);
  }
       </code> </pre>

       <h3> Microphone Sensor </h3>
<p>Finally, the sensor I decided to make was with the microphone module that I found in the lab. The hook up to the arduino nano board was pretty straight forward. <br>
gnd to gnd. Vcc to 3.3 pin. Out to A0 (analoge A0) </p>

<h4> The Code</h>
  <p>Here is the code I used that seemed to work quite well.</p>


  <pre><code class="language-arduino">
  /*
    Program to capture the intensity of sound input from a microphone.  Uses an exponential running average.

  */
  int sound1, sound2;
  float diff_sq;
  float eps = 0.1;      //This constant determines the amount that each data point changes the running average.  A smaller
                        // value makes the response slower.
  float accum;          // The number that accumulates the running average.
  void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);     // initialize serial communication at 115200 bits per second:
  }


  void loop() {
     sound1= analogRead(A0);
     delay(1);                  //delay.  Determines what frequencies are detected.  At 1 mS, detection is best at ~ 300 Hz.
     sound2= analogRead(A0);
     diff_sq = float((sound1 - sound2) * (sound1-sound2));    //Take the difference between two points on the waveform.
                                                              //Then square, to make it positive.
     accum = accum*(1-eps)+ diff_sq * eps;
     Serial.println(accum);

  }

   </code> </pre>
