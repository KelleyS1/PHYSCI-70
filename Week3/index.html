  <h3>Week 3: Hands tools and Fabrication </h3> <br>
  <div class="row">

      <p> This week, I'm not entirely sure I fulfilled the prompt, unfortunately, but I did make something that moves!
      I was focused on a moving kinect piece rather than one of joints. But I did use a ton of tools and worked with many
    different materials, such as brass, acyrillic, wood. And I used many of the tools in the lab to cut these materials. Which I think
  was the heart of this week...using the hand tools and making something new. <br>
Without further ado, I made a Alexander Calder Mobile inspired kinetic sculpture. </p>
